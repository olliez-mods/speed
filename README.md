Made with SFML, not sure what version, the link doesn't work, go into the resources folder to run .exe

Speed is a card game where you place cards on one of two stacks going either up or down.

[YouTube tortorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDsd6MG3t4w)

This has LAN play and there's no need to host a server as the client comes with server built in.

Once you get into a game keep restarting the game untill both clientsare synced.

To play:

    Refer to the YouTube tortorial (above) for how to play
    
    Click your pile of cards (bottom left) it will spit out a card. You can select
    your card by clicking on it, then, if it's valid either press the pile you want
    the card to go to, or pressLeft or Right arrow keys.
    
    To flip over new cards, both players need to click the face down pile in the middle
    of the board (it is not nesasary to click it at the same time, only that both player
    HAVE clicked it)
    
    Once your pile of face down cards no longer spits out anything and your hand is empty
    YOU WIN!

If you both get to a point where you dont have any cards to put in the center, click the stack of cards in the middle, once both of you have done this new cards will flip over and the game ocntinues
