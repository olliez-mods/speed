Made with SFML, not sure what version, the link doesn't work, go into the resources folder to run .exe

Speed is a card game where you place cards on one of two stacks going either up or down.

This has LAN play and there's no need to host a server as the client comes with server built in.

Once you get into a game keep restarting the game untill both clients update at the same time.

Then click your pile of cards (bottom left) it will spit out a card, if your card is one higher or lower then 
one of the cards in the center then you can select your card and click the pile in the center you want your card 
to go onto, winner is the first one to run out of cards.

If you both get to a point where you dont have any cards to put in the center, click the stack of cards in the middle, once both of you have done this new cards will flip over and the game ocntinues
